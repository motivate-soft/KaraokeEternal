## Features

- Supports:
  - MP3+G with Winamp/MilkDrop visualizations (WebGL 2)
  - MP4 videos
  - ReplayGain tags for volume normalization
- Fast, modern mobile browser app designed for "karaoke conditions"
- Multiple simultaneous rooms/queues (optionally password-protected)
- Dynamic queues keep parties fair, fun and no-fuss
- Fully self-hosted
- No ads or telemetry

Microphones are *not* required since the player itself only outputs music - this allows your audio setup to be as simple or complex as you like. See the <a href='{{< ref "faq.md/#whats-the-recommended-audiomicrophone-setup" >}}'>F.A.Q.</a> for more information.

- **<a href='{{< ref "docs/karaoke-eternal-server" >}}'>Server:</a>** Runs on pretty much anything to serve the web app and your media files, including a Windows PC, Mac, or a dedicated server like a Raspberry Pi or Synology NAS.
- **<a href='{{< ref "docs/karaoke-eternal-app" >}}'>App:</a>** Fast, modern mobile web app designed for "karaoke conditions".
- **<a href='{{< ref "docs/karaoke-eternal-app/#player" >}}'>Player:</a>** Just another part of the app, but meant to run fullscreen on the system handling audio/video for a <a href='{{< ref "docs/karaoke-eternal-app/#rooms-admin-only" >}}'>room</a>.
