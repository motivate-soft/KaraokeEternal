Microphones are *not* required since the player itself only outputs music - this allows your audio setup to be as simple or complex as you like. See the [F.A.Q.](https://www.karaoke-eternal.com/faq/#whats-the-recommended-audiomicrophone-setup) for more information.

## Getting Started

 Karaoke Eternal basically has 3 parts. See [Getting Started](https://www.karaoke-eternal.com/docs/getting-started/) to get up and running step-by-step, or jump to the documentation for each part below:
 
- **[Server:](https://www.karaoke-eternal.com/docs/karaoke-eternal-server/)** Runs on pretty much anything to serve the web app and your media files, including a Windows PC, Mac, or a dedicated server like a Raspberry Pi or Synology NAS.
- **[App:](https://www.karaoke-eternal.com/docs/karaoke-eternal-app/)** Fast, modern mobile web app designed for "karaoke conditions".
- **[Player:](https://www.karaoke-eternal.com/docs/karaoke-eternal-app/#player)** Just another part of the app, but meant to run fullscreen on the system handling audio/video for a [room](https://www.karaoke-eternal.com/docs/karaoke-eternal-app/#rooms-admin-only)
